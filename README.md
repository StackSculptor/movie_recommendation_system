# movie_recommendation_system

Introducing the Movie Recommendation System, designed to provide movie suggestions based on given movie titles. Leveraging advanced algorithms, it sifts through movie descriptions to generate a list of films with similar content, offering users a curated viewing experience.


    Content-Based Filtering: Uses movie descriptions to find similarities and recommend films.
    User-Friendly Interface: Command-line-based interactions for straightforward recommendations.
    Scalable: Easily expandable to include more movie titles and descriptions for broader recommendations.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    scikit-learn
    pandas

Installation

    Clone this repository:
